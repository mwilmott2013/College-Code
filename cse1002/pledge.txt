I pledge that every program with my name on it shall be written by me
(and my co-authors, if any) and that I fully understand the program.
Every program I submit shall be entirely my own work unless otherwise
attributed.  I understand that academic dishonesty not only includes
copying other people's work, but also abetting or facilitating
copying.  Code that is similar to any other submission past or present
will get no credit whatever the explanation.  I understand that the
consequence of academic dishonesty is a grade of 'F' for the class.  I
pledge to devote my efforts to learning Java by writing my own
programs.  I shall strive to be attentive to detail and write programs
that not only compile and execute correctly, but are easily
understandable by myself and other programmers.
