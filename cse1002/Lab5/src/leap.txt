I saw that the changed probabilities drastically affect the page ranks.  If the probabilities were changed to 80-20, the page ranks are affected.
Page 23, for example, had its page rank drop by a whole .01.  When probabilities were altered to 95-5,
Page 23 was boosted by .006. Thus, it stands to reason that if probabilities move higher, the page ranks move higher, and 
if the probabilities move lower, the page ranks move lower.
